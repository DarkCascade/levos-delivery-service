Levo's Delivery Service [Android Puzzle]

As the new courier for Levo's Delivery Service, you're in charge of getting your customers' packages to their
destinations as fast as possible! Draw paths around town to find the most optimal route to your destination.
Watch out for traffic and other obstacles! Use cash from successful deliveries to buy better and faster vehicles!

Sample Gameplay
---------------

The player selects their town from the menu, and selects "Start Game". The player is presented with a top-down
view of the selected town, with available route nodes shown in gray. The game's timer will be reset to the town's
default value and shown to the player. The available package sources are highlighted
in green. The player will draw a route from the courier's current position to the package source of their choice,
then continue the route to that package's destination. The player can carry up to a certain number of packages at once
(determined by their vehicle). Available destinations based on currently held packages will be highlighted as well.
Levo (the owner of the delivery service) has a serious fear of left turns. Using GPS embedded in the player's
vehicle, he will dock pay for each left turn taken by the player. All left turns will result in a message being
displayed shortly (something like "Left Turn!" in red). The game will track all left turns made and will deduct
accordingly at the end of the session. When time runs out, the player will be shown their results: total packages
delivered, cash gained, and cash lost through left turns. The player is then taken to the menu, with the ability
to buy items and vehicles at the store, select a new town, or quit. The player's current cash total will be displayed
on the menu screen for easy reference.

Abstract
--------
Levo's Delivery Service is a top-down puzzler focused on allowing the player to discover the quickest ways around
town to deliver packages in the shortest amount of time. Offering quick gameplay and a sense of urgency through
diminishing time and mounting left turn totals (based on the player's play style), the game offers fast, exciting
gameplay with replay value through new vehicle purchases and new towns to explore.
